#WDI-Project-1

Welcome to **"Alien Attack"** web application game. First project for *WDI-LONDON*


##Introduction
**"Alien Attack"** is a one player shooting game based on the famous **Duck-Hunt** game. **Duck-Hunt** first released in Japan on April 21, 1984. Using JavaScript, I recreated this game for my first project after 3 weeks  at General Assembly (Web Development Immersive course). A hosted version of **Alien Attack** can be found [here] (https://secure-plateau-53161.herokuapp.com/) The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/hassanisk/wdi-project-1).

##How To PLAY
###Main

<img width="476" alt="screen shot 2017-03-21 at 15 34 30" src="http://i.imgur.com/8DgzUWJ.jpg"> <br>
This is the main interface when the game starts. The grid with the planets are is the main body where the game will actually happen. The red start button on top is used to start the game. The amount of ammo, score and restart option are located on the left side of the grid. 
###Start

Once the game has started, UFOs will start to spawn from the right side of the grid. Once clicked inside the grid,the amount of ammos will minus 1 but the score will add 1 only when an UFO is eliminated.
Clicking on UFOs would eliminate them, but not when they are located behind the planets or the grass.
If player's score reaches 5 the speed of the ufo will increase, as well at score of 10.

###End

The game will end when the player ran out of ammo. Player could press on the hazard button to nuke the whole galaxy! A restart button could be used to reset.
##Further Work
I would like to include more levels with a higher UFO speed and a timer for each level. At the moment there is no indication between the difference of the levels. A message should be added.
Make it responsive since this version is not mobile friendly.
