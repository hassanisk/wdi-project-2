# wdi-project-2

Welcome to the **"Popcorn and Chill"** online movie website. Thie was the second project for *WDI-LONDON*
A hosted version can be found [here] (https://movie-pedia.herokuapp.com/). The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/hassanisk/wdi-project-2).


##Introduction
**"Popcorn and Chill"** is an online movie website community, which allows you to search for movies and add recommended movies. The idea behind this website is to allow users to search for and find any movie as well as recommend movies to all other users. The user can check all recommended movies and watch the trailers.

##How to use the app
###Home page

This is the home page. The navigation bar exists on all pages to facilitate navigation. The *logo* on the left is reponsive and will take the user back to the home page, when clicked. On the right are the *log in* and *register* options. The title has "popcorn" as a gif to resemble popping popcorn. When the user hovers the curser around the page, images of famous movie characters will appear, adding an element of interactivity with the user.

###MoviePedia
<img width="550" alt="screen shot 2017-03-21 at 15 34 30" src="http://i.imgur.com/BaryXOir.jpg"><br>
MoviePedia is a social network of movie recommendations, which allows users to add recommendations for other users and edit information for  existing ones.

###Movie info page

When the user clicks on a movie, they will be redirected to an 'info' page, which contains the trailer and a summary of the plot.


###Planning
<img width="550" alt="screen shot 2017-03-21 at 15 34 30" src="http://i.imgur.com/PQYBafZ.png">
Using [trello.com] (https://www.trello.com]/), I created a schedule with specific tasks to help me work through the project with clear objectives and goals to achieve, within the timeframes and deadlines.
###Wireframing
<img width="550" alt="screen shot 2017-03-21 at 15 34 30" src="http://i.imgur.com/5R5ArSO.png">
Using [balsamiq.com] (https://www.balsamiq.com/), I created wireframes to plan and decide the layout, nagivation and the ideal user interface. 

##Further Work
I would like to include more features for users. For example, a user profile page could include a profile picture, status, comments, and favourites with an option of adding other users to a friend list.
