Welcome to **"Popcorn and Chill"** online movie website. Second project for *WDI-LONDON*


##Introduction
**"Popcorn and Chill"** is an online movie website community which allows you to search movies and add recommended movies. The idea behind this website is to allow users to search and find all movies, and to recommand movies to all users. The user could check all recommended movies and watch their trailers. A hosted version is found [here] (https://secure-atoll-92904.herokuapp.com/). The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/hassanisk/wdi-project-2).

Using [trello.com] (https://www.trello.com]/), I created a scheduale with tasks to help me with the flow of the project with clear objectives and goals to achieve under timeframes and deadlines.
###Wireframing

Using [balsamiq.com] (https://www.balsamiq.com/), I created some wireframes to plan and decide on the layout, nagivation and the ideal user interface 

##Further Work
I would like to include more features especially for the users. A user profile page includes profile photo, status, comments, and favourites with an option of adding other users to a friend list.
