##Introduction
**"Popcorn and Chill"** is an online movie website community which allows you to search movies and add recommended movies. This web application include authentications, I recreated this game for my first project after 3 weeks  at General Assembly (Web Development Immersive course). A hosted version of **"Popcorn and Chill"** can be found [here] (https://git.heroku.com/secure-atoll-92904.git) The code can be viewed [here] (https://github.com/hassanisk/wdi-project-2).

##How To PLAY
###Main

<img width="476" alt="screen shot 2017-03-21 at 15 34 30" src="http://i.imgur.com/8DgzUWJ.jpg"> <br>
This is the home page. The navigation bar exists on any page to facilitate navigation. The *logo* on the left is reponsive and will take the user back to the home page once clicked. On the right, *log in* and *register* options. The title has "popcorn" as gif to ressemble the popping popcorn. Once the user hover around the page, images of famous movies characters will appear to add interactivity with the user.

The user could either log in or register. Once logged in, the navbar changes to show new sections options. *Search*, *MoviePedia* and *Add Movie*. If clicked on *Search*, a new input option would appear. This 

The grid with the planets are is the main body where the game will actually happen. The red start button on top is used to start the game. The amount of ammo, score and restart option are located on the left side of the grid. 
###Start

Once the game has started, UFOs will start to spawn from the right side of the grid. Once clicked inside the grid,the amount of ammos will minus 1 but the score will add 1 only when an UFO is eliminated.
Clicking on UFOs would eliminate them, but not when they are located behind the planets or the grass.
If player's score reaches 5 the speed of the ufo will increase, as well at score of 10.

###End

<img width="476" alt="screen shot 2017-03-21 at 15 34 30" src="http://i.imgur.com/DJwhbKa.jpg"><br>
The game will end when the player ran out of ammo. Player could press on the hazard button to nuke the whole galaxy! A restart button could be used to reset.
